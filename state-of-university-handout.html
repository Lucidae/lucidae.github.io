    <h2>UHDS Handout for the State of the University Address</h2>
		<p class="text-block">University Housing &amp; Dining Services wanted to educate attendees of the 2018 State of the University Address on what they do, and how they do it well. Part of that effort was a double-sided handout with information and images about UHDS, which is what I designed. Check out the <a href="#process"><u>process</u></a> below!
		</p>

		<p class="text-block">For this project I decided to try and focus on one of Oregon State University's personality traits as shown in the university brand guidelines. I did this in an effort to communicate a stronger tone than usual. The trait I chose for this piece was confident.

		<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
		<p class="text-block"><strong>Step 1: Analyze</strong>
		<br>
		This project was unusual, because it was suddenly assigned with a quick turnaround. An email was sent to me explaining the situation with a large amount of raw text, which can be seen below (with my annotation on top of course). Due to the situation I was given free reign on how to disseminate the text and choice of sub headers.

		<p class="text-block"><strong>Step 2: Sketches</strong>
		<br>
		Once I had settled on how I wanted to organize the text given to me, I began to sketch potential layouts.

		<p class="text-block"><strong>Step 3: Digital Development</strong>
		<br>
		I started off working with my favorite layout sketch in InDesign. As I worked, I would occasionally do a test print to get a better grasp on how the design was developing. It would help me make stronger decisions on what to adjust.

		<p class="text-block"><strong>Step 4: Review</strong>
		<br>
		Once I felt like the work was ready for review by my managers, I printed the handout and waited for them to evaluate it.

		<p class="text-block">After making the requested changes, the handout was sent to the printer and distributed at the State of the University Address.
